*Your privacy-first, first line of defense online.*

A browser extension developed by **Team Polymeowphism**

## üöÄ Overview

**LionGuard** is a lightweight, privacy-respecting browser extension that provides real-time protection against modern web threats. It is specifically designed to address common online scam patterns prevalent in Singapore, acting as an intelligent co-pilot for your browsing sessions.

The core problem we address is the vulnerability of everyday users to sophisticated phishing attacks and the inadvertent leakage of **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**. Existing security tools often lack the context to detect localized scam tactics or the nuance to prevent accidental data submission on untrusted sites.

LionGuard stands out by being:
* **Singapore-Focused:** Uniquely tailored to recognize local identifiers like **NRIC/FIN** and common scam phrases.
* **PII-Aware:** Unlike typical blockers, LionGuard actively monitors form inputs to prevent you from submitting sensitive data to malicious sites.
* **Privacy-First:** All processing is done locally within your browser by default. No personal data is sent to external servers without your explicit consent.

### Key Features
* üõ°Ô∏è **Real-time Malicious URL Scanner:** Checks websites against known blocklists and alerts you before you land on a dangerous page.
* üîé **PII Detection Engine:** Intelligently identifies input fields for sensitive information (NRIC, phone numbers, credit cards) and displays a non-intrusive warning on untrusted pages.
* üìß **Email Breach Checker:** A quick, at-a-glance tool to see if your email address has been compromised in known data breaches.
* üìä **Simple Dashboard:** A clean popup UI that provides immediate stats on sites flagged and PII warnings triggered, giving you a clear picture of how LionGuard is protecting you.
